# Template-matching-on-a-BMP-image
This project is written in C language, using the principle of Procedural Programming and receives as input a BMP image ("test.bmp") 
and recognizes and outlines with different colors the digits given as input as a BMP image ("cifra0.bmp" - "cifra9.bmp") using the matching template algorithm.
